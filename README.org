** Manual installation
   First, [[https://gitlab.com/tygrdev/org-real/-/releases][download the latest release]] (=org-real-x.y.z.el=)

*** Try it out
    You can try it out in the current emacs session with:

    =M-x load-file RET org-real-x.y.z.el=
*** Permanent installation
    Or you can install it permanently by running:

    =M-x package-install-file RET org-real-x.y.z.el=

    and adding the following to your init file.

    Bare bones:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (require 'org-real)
    #+end_src

    Or, for use-package (defaults shown)
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package org-real
       :init
       (setq org-real-default-visibility 2
             org-real-flex-width 80
             org-real-tooltips t
             org-real-tooltip-timeout 0.5
             org-real-include-context t
             org-real-margin-x 2
             org-real-margin-y 1
             org-real-padding-x 2
             org-real-padding-y 1))
   #+end_src
*** Manual upgrade
    Download the latest release and run:
    =M-x package-install-file RET org-real-x.y.z.el=

* Usage
** Inserting a link
   To create a real link in org-mode, use =C-c C-l real RET=.

   Real links are created inside-out, starting with the most specific
   item and working to the most general.

   #+end_example

   The first prompt will be for the thing which is trying to be linked
   to, called the "primary thing". Then, the prompt will continue to
   ask if more context should be added by pressing =+= until the user
   confirms the link with =RET=.

   [[file:demo/insert-link.gif]]

** Inserting a link with completion

   Org real will help create links by parsing all existing links in
   the current buffer. When choosing an existing thing, all of the
   context for that thing is automatically added to the current
   completion.

   This is only possible because of the unique inside-out completion
   style for inserting a link and makes it very easy to add new things
   to an existing container.

   [[file:demo/insert-link-with-completion.gif]]

** Rearranging things

   In order to edit a real link, place the cursor on the link and
   press =C-c C-l=. Narrow the link down beyond the context you wish
   to change by pressing =BACKSPACE= repeatedly, then =+= to add the
   new context.

   [[file:demo/edit-link.gif]]

   If any container in the new link does not match an existing
   container in the buffer, org-real will prompt you to replace all
   occurences of that thing with the new context and relationships.

   This makes it easy to keep things in sync. If any one link changes
   location, all links in the currnet buffer are updated accordingly.

   [[file:demo/apply-changes.gif]]

   If a link is changed manually, use the interactive function
   =org-real-apply= with the cursor on top of the new link to apply
   changes from that link to the buffer.

** Org Real mode

   To open a real link, place the cursor within the link and press
   =C-c C-o=. This will display a popup buffer in Org Real mode
   showing the location of the link. Use =S-TAB= to cycle the
   visibility level of all children or just =TAB= to toggle the
   visibility of children for a single box.

   In the org real diagram, emacs movement keys will navigate by boxes
   rather than characters. Each box in the diagram has these options:

   - =RET / mouse-1= Jump to first occurrence of link
   - =o= Cycle occurrences of links in other window
   - =M-RET= Open all occurences of links by splitting the current window
   - =r= Jump to the box directly related to the current box

   [[file:demo/org-real-mode.gif]]

** =org-real-world=

   To view all real links in the current buffer in a combined diagram,
   use the interactive function =org-real-world=

   Suggested keybinding:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c r w") 'org-real-world)
   #+end_src

** =org-real-headlines=

   To view all headlines in an org-mode file as an org-real diagram,
   use the interactive function =org-real-headlines=

   Suggested keybinding:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c r o") 'org-real-headlines)
   #+end_src

   To modify the relationship between a headline and its parent, add
   the property REL to the child headline. Valid values are:
   - on top of
   - in front of
   - behind
   - above
   - below
   - to the right of
   - to the left of
