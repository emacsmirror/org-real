* Status *PARTIALLY WORKING*

** TODO Allow things to have multiple children with the same preposition
** TODO =org-real-world= flex layout sometimes draws over existing boxes
** TODO Ask to replace all occurences after editing a link

** Inserting a link
   To create a real link in org-mode, use =C-c C-l real RET=.

   Real links are created inside-out, starting with the most specific
   item and working to the most general.

   The first prompt will be for the thing which is trying to be linked
   to, called the "primary thing". Then, the prompt will continue to
   ask if more context should be added by pressing =+= until the user
   confirms the link with =RET=.

** Inserting a link with completion

   Org real will help create links by parsing all existing links in
   the current buffer. When choosing an existing thing, all of the
   context for that thing is automatically added to the current
   completion.

   This is only possible because of the unique inside-out completion
   style for inserting a link and makes it very easy to add new things
   to an existing container.

** Rearranging things

   In order to edit a real link, place the cursor on the link and
   press =C-c C-l=. Narrow the link down beyond the context you wish
   to change by pressing =BACKSPACE= repeatedly, then =+= to add the
   new context.

** Opening links

   To open a link, place the cursor within the link and press =C-c
   C-o=. This will display a popup buffer showing the location of the
   thing described by the link.

** =org-real-world= (expirimental)
   
   To view all real links in the current buffer in a combined diagram,
   use the interactive function =org-real-world=
